# web-design-challenge

This project focused on creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations. Specifically, we'll it plots data from [weather data](WebVisualizations/Resources/cities.csv).

The dashboard shows individual pages for each plot and a means by which one can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. The site includes the following pages: landing page, a comparison page for all plots, and a page to view the data used.
